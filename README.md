## Assets Insight

<h2>For my "Back End Eind Project (BEEP)" I have created a website where you can write blog articles. Named "Assets Insight"</h2>

## Local installation
<p>For local installation, you must follow these steps:</p>

## Requirements
1. <h3>A program that can run a database and php files, like Xampp or MAMP</h3>
2. <h3>A text editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text to get information for the database</h3>

## Installation
1. <h3>To install the Blog site you must put all the files in a folder, this ensures that everything works well together.</h3>
2. <h3>Then you must create a database, this can be done by the file: <a href="../backend-eindproject/database/import.sql">import.sql</a>. Also i have a simple video for the installation: <a href="https://youtu.be/jW5lrS6EUPM?si=rtQI_hJXMBhj2y89">Link to installation video</a></h3>
3. <h3>If all done, you succesfuly installed the database of Assets Insight!</h3>
4. <h3>To get the styles of Assets insight, you must put the following command in the folder terminal: "npm i"</h3>
5. <h3>To active the site and database it's important to open MAMP or Xampp and launch a server</h3>
6. <h3>You can now access the website by going to localhost/foldername in your browser.</h3>

## Online
Due to security reasons, it's recommended to host the website locally instead of online. This is why i don't put it online.
